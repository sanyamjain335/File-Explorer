# File Explorer using system calls:-

The file explorer works in two modes:-

`1. Normal Mode`
`2. Command Mode`

Normal Mode is used to traverse through various directories and perform some of these following operations:-

1. View all files and directories
2. Navigate through the directories
3. Open a file or insert into a particular directory
4. Traverse through directories(previously visited directory, parent directory, Home directory)

On pressing `Shift+":"`, User will be directed to Command Mode.

Command Mode is used to perform elementary operations on files and directories like:-

1. Copy, Move and Rename directory.
2. Create files and directories.
3. Delete files and directories.
4. Goto particular directory.
5. Search within a directory.

Again on pressing `ESC`, User will be redirected to Normal Mode.
